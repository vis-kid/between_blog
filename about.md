This is the official blog for the podcast [Between \| Screens](http://google.com/). Here you will find synopses of newly released episodes and the occasional technical blog post.

Expect to find content about the following topics:
Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Design Patterns, Jekyll, Reponsive Design, Git, Javascript, Client-Side Web Apps, Typopgraphy, Web Design, Sass, Prototyping, Letter Design and more â€¦  

The elevator pitch for this podcast is to conduct interviews with professional designers & developers and distill multiple small digestible knowledge bombs out of these conversations. The show will leave out the industry insider chit chat, include beginners / newbies into the conversation and keep most episodes under 15 minutes.

Your feedback is always welcome. Reaching out on Twitter via [@BetweenScreens\_](http://twitter.com/BetweenScreens_) is a good start for any conversation.

Have a nice day!
