This is the official blog for the podcast [Between \| Screens](http://google.com/). Here you will find synopses of newly released episodes and the occasional technical blog post.

Expect to find content about the following topics:
Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Sass, Javascript, Design Patterns, Jekyll, Client-Side Web Apps, Typography, Git, Responsive Design, Prototyping, Web Design,  Type Design and more â€¦  

The elevator pitch for this micro-podcast is to conduct extensive interviews with professional designers & developers and distill multiple small & free digestible knowledge bombs out of these conversations. The show will leave out the industry insider chit chat, include beginners / newbies into the conversation and keep most episodes under 15 minutes.

Your feedback is always welcome. Reaching out on Twitter via [@BetweenScreens\_](http://twitter.com/BetweenScreens_) is a good start for any conversation.

Have a nice day!
