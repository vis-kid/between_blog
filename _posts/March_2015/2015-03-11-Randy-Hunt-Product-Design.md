This is a clean read transcription of my interview about product design with the creative director at Etsy Randy J. Hunt.

***Q:** There is like UI design, UX design, Visual design, Interaction design, Information Architecture and the likes, what’s your opinion about splitting up these positions when designing for the web?*

**Randy J. Hunt:** So my general position on this is that they’re best when they’re blurry, you know and combined together. I think that some of these disciplines like Information Architecture or the sort of world of UX, has been around under that terminology for quite some time now, a decade, a decade and a half or something, and has it’s own language and point of view about these things, but they are not mutually exclusive. You know, in a lot of ways an interaction designer is doing UX, it’s a really kinda funny thing to hear them even talked about split up because it’s hard for me to see the lines between them. Many of them overlap or are different terminologies for the same thing.

My tendency is to try to compress those things together and see them together in the same individual and in the same thought process. I’ve learned over time that of course there are experts in some of these discrete areas and it can be very helpful to have their point of view or to learn from these experts, but overall I feel like in the process of building the product itself, in the sort of day-to-day work, that the separations between those different disciplines isn’t particularly helpful and that the generalist across them ends up making for a better overall product experience. 

Often in the world that is described as UX, there is a whole set of research and research-driven methodologies that live under that umbrella and I often found that, and in fact we structured our team (@Etsy) this way over time, there are expert researchers who don’t self-identify as designers in the product execution sense and really see themselves as pure researchers and I actually find that to be quite productive to have that part of a discipline that is a bit more discrete and done by different people. 

***Q:** So you believe one can wear all these different hats product designers might need?*

**Randy J. Hunt:** Yeah, I believe it *[laughing]*, I mean I see it every day so I think it’s possible. I don’t really buy the this somehow unattainable ideal that a person can’t satisfy all these things. I think there is this dangerous thing that’s happened, or a couple of things. One is this idea that the designer who codes creates an assumption that this is somehow more efficient, almost from a headcount or cost standpoint. You know like I’m a person with a small startup and I don’t have a ton of resources, if I can get a designer who codes, I’ve kinda got like two people for one. And that totally misses the point! If that’s what you are expecting to get out of something like that then you’ll be thoroughly disappointed *[laughing]*. It’s not about somehow having one person doing two people’s work, it’s rather really important that the designer is able to understand the medium in which they are working as much as possible—with the most detail and the most depth they possibly can.

***Q:** And vice versa right?*

**Randy J. Hunt:** Absolutely! I don’t think that excludes them from also having deep knowledge about other domains as well. The idea that somehow a designer may have great expertise in typography and also be able to build simple web applications from the ground up doesn’t seem impossible to me because I’ve done it myself, I’ve seen other people do it and these are the kinds of people we like to hire. If we’re hiring more inexperienced people then the way we like to develop these people’s experience is to become like extremely well rounded and that’s not about about skating across the surface of those things. We actually expect that they have deep knowledge in several disciplines.
