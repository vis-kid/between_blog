Over the last couple of years I listened to my fair share of podcasts about web stuff. There are plenty of great podcasts out there and I have an enormous respect for them. The Ruby, Javascript and Design communities can feel very lucky and proud to have so many ambitious people producing great shows spreading knowledge.

This project has a simple goal in mind: Producing short knowledge bombs about web technologies & people in the industry and include beginners / newbies in the conversation. I intend to make it a regular show that is about learning from experts who share their knowledge and their experiences with you. It should help folks learn new technologies and design techniques while they commute, work out, eat breakfast, travel or simply walk their dog during lunch like I often do myself.

There is a great deal of people who don’t have access to the fantastic learning infrastructure or meetup ecosystem that the infamous tech hubs so effortlessly and abundantly offer every day. They are simply cut off because they live more remote and the next networking / meetup opportunities to learn from friendly advanced people are far off. Another scenario might be, living in an area where the local meetup culture is weird and uninviting and feels like a waste of time. Being broke and not being able to afford premium resources to advance one’s skill level affect another big chunk of people as well for sure. I’ve been there and it’s not the best place to learn and grow if you don’t have regular access to people who are far beyond your level of skill and who wanna share their knowledge with you. I can only hope that this project can make a small contribution spreading knowledge about web technologies for free and make easily accessible.
