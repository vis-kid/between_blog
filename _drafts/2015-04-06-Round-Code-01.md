# **#01:** [**Chad Pytel**](http://betweenscreens.fm/episodes/82)

Topics discussed include:

* God objects

* Clean migrations
* Rat’s nest resources
* Integration points
* Mocks & Testing

[**Chad Pytel**](https://twitter.com/cpytel) is a developer, co-founder and CEO of [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com). He wrote the excellent book [“Rails AnitPatterns”](http://railsantipatterns.com), occasionally hosts the [Giant Robots](http://giantrobots.fm) podcast and let’s his employees work on Open Source every Friday as part of their investment time.


>#**“**

>### Never, ever, ever, user your models in the migrations.
>
>#**”** 

In this episode Chad discusses some Rails AntiPatterns and how to clean them up. He explains God objects, how they attract too much responsibility, why the decorator and presenter patterns are useful for organizing view logic and how to write clean migrations that don’t cause headaches for anybody.   

We further talk about why convoluted controllers are called “Rat’s Nest resources”, what integration points are and how to test them at the unit and integration level.

# **#02:** [**Tom Dale**](http://betweenscreens.fm/episodes/72)

Topics discussed include:

* Why Ember?
* Corporate entities
* Browser apps
* JavaScript
* Designers
* Glimmer & FastBoot
* Ember’s Future

[**Tom Dale**](https://twitter.com/tomdale), jokingly self-proclaimed JavaScript ombudsman, is a co-founder of [Tilde](http://www.tilde.io), works on Open Source as an [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) core member and is an excellent conference speaker. 


>#**“** 
>
>### I believe truly that the web belongs to mankind and I think it’s as revolutionary, or more so, than the printing press.
>
>#**”** 

Tom talks about why he believes that the web is probably the most important invention of mankind, what he thinks about the mobile web & corporations, and how browsers evolved from being vehicles serving documents into a platform for developing applications.  

You will also hear what’s cool about Ember, why JavaScript became so central for building web apps and why Tom rejects the idea that it’s necessary for designers to become programmers. He will also talk about the near future of Ember, the new rendering engine [Glimmer](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/10501) and how awesome [FastBoot](http://emberjs.com/blog/2014/12/22/inside-fastboot-the-road-to-server-side-rendering.html) will be by delivering HTML and CSS before JavaScript takes over on the client.

# **#03:** [**Steve Klabnik**](http://betweenscreens.fm/episodes/2)

Topics discussed include:

* Design patterns
* Origins
* Important patterns
* How to learn & apply them
* Bad reputation?

[**Steve Klabnik**](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik) is a prolific Open Source developer for projects like Rails & Rust, author of [Rails in Action](http://www.manning.com/bigg2/) & [Rust for Rubyists](http://www.rustforrubyists.com), well traveled conference speaker, does not hesitate to argue against capitalism and saved [Hackety Hack](http://hackety.com)

>#**“** 
>
>### Java people tend to use a lot of design patterns but that’s because their language does not have a lot of expressive stuff. I don’t think that means that Java is bad, but some people do. 
>
>#**”** 

Steve Klabnik explains that design patterns are useful for organizing software by giving names to common solutions and describes them as missing programming features. They make it easier to talk about implementations, at least until they become jargon that can confuse people not so familiar with these patterns.

He also names a few important patterns to look into first, talks about beginners learning to apply them and leveling up in problem solving abilities. You will also get a balanced answer to the question why design patterns have a bad reputation.

In this interview, Chris gives a detailed insight into how Github works and operates. Github changed significantly over the last 18 months but is still super remote friendly. We also talk about the company’s street cred, how they organize teams and why managers became important more recently.  

I also wanted to know how the onboarding was like, how Chris dealt with the initial firehose and what they plan regarding juniors and interns in the future. You will also hear about the internal tone, how flexible people can structure their work and how Github picks up the bill for conferences and stuff.
